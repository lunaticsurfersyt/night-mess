# night-mess
Night Mess is an on-campus and off-campus late-night food delivery service aimed at students and locals, offering warm, affordable, and hygienic meals with a student-first mindset. The idea is inspired by the rapid delivery convenience of Blinkit and the food diversity and reliability of Swiggy, but fine-tuned for late-night hunger needs.
